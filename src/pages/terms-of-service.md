Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the https://gitrevue.io website (the "Service") operated by iWader Limited ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.

### Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the same conditions unless you cancel it or iWader Limited cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting iWader Limited customer support team.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide iWader Limited with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, postal code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize iWader Limited to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, iWader Limited will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

iWader Limited reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.

Prices of all Service(s), including but not limited to monthly subscription fees to the Service, are subject to change upon 30 days notice from us. Such notice may be provided at any time by email or the Service itself.

iWader Limited shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.

### Free Trial

iWader Limited may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").

You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.

If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by iWader Limited until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.

At any time and without notice, iWader Limited reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

### Fee Changes

iWader Limited, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

iWader Limited will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.

### Refunds

Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by iWader Limited on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of iWader Limited.

### Accounts

When you create an account with us, you must provide us information that is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.

You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.
